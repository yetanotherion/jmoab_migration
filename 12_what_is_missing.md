# What is missing

- Gradle scripts are good:
   - far easier to extend
   - allows and encourages designs based on convention


--

- **Our** Gradle scripts are so-so:
   - the result of a semi-automated conversion
   - versioning of external dependencies is still tricky
   - scala migration should be far easier (in the build scripts)
