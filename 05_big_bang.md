### Big bang (May 2017)

Idea:
* Use a converter that will be capable of converting all poms in one shot.
* Use two jmoab: one full maven, one full gradle compare the two until results are the same.
* Merge big-cross repo when everything is done
* [@oehme](https://github.com/oehme) Gradle perf lead: +1!

[Feasibility study](https://confluence.criteois.com/display/RP/Feasibility+of+maven+to+gradle+automated+translation)

--
* 637 pom.xml

--
* 50 reviews merged per week on pom

--
* if we automate the translation of 28 / 47 maven plugins, it may be ok
