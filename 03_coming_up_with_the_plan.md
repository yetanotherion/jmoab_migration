# Goals to reach

[JMOAB2 Kick-off (Aug/2017)](https://confluence.criteois.com/display/RP/Kick-off%3A+Towards+an+Efficient+JMOAB)

--
 * Reduce the duration of JMOAB-build to less than 30 minutes.

--
 * Reduce the duration of JMOAB-pre-submit to less than 30 minutes (worst case scenario).

--
 * Make JMOAB-build and JMOAB-pre-submit scale with respect to the code base size.

--
 * Pave the way for later improvements (i.e. choose a build tool which can be easily customized and is actively maintained)
