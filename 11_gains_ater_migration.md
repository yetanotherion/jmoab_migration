# Nearing the end

- What has changed:
   - Criteo code gained some more weight:
      - ~~239~~ 304 repositories
      - ~~652~~ 1127 artifacts
   - Build times:
      - a new MOAB each 30 min
      - presubmit on whole moab ~ 90 min
- What we learned:
   - uber jars and package generation is a mess:
      - no real common knowledge on what's in what's out
      - in most cases, just copying what works
   -
