# Big bang (May 2017)

Idea:
* Use a converter that will be capable of converting all poms in one shot.
* Use two jmoab: one full maven, one full gradle compare the two until results are the same
* Merge big-cross repo when everything is done
* [@oehme](https://github.com/oehme) Gradle perf lead: +1!

[Feasibility study](https://confluence.criteois.com/display/RP/Feasibility+of+maven+to+gradle+automated+translation)
* 637 pom.xml
* 50 reviews merged per week on pom
* 50 maven plugins, if we automate the translation of 28 chosen plugins, it may be ok.
